 *
 * `@helia/verified-fetch` provides a [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)-like API for retrieving content from the [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) network.
 *
 * All content is retrieved in a [trustless manner](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/trustless), and the integrity of all bytes are verified by comparing hashes of the data.
 *
 * This is a marked improvement over `fetch` which offers no such protections and is vulnerable to all sorts of attacks like [Content Spoofing](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Content_Spoofing), [DNS Hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_hijacking), etc.
 *
 * A `verifiedFetch` function is exported to get up and running quickly, and a `createVerifiedFetch` function is also available that allows customizing the underlying [Helia](https://helia.io/) node for complete control over how content is retrieved.
 *
 * Browser-cache-friendly [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects are returned which should be instantly familiar to web developers.
 *
 * You may use any supported resource argument to fetch content:
 *
 * - [CID](https://multiformats.github.io/js-multiformats/classes/cid.CID.html) instance
 * - IPFS URL
 * - IPNS URL
 *
 * @example Getting started
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { verifiedFetch } from '@helia/verified-fetch'
 *
 * const resp = await verifiedFetch('ipfs://bafy...')
 *
 * const json = await resp.json()
 *```
 *
 * @example Using a CID instance to fetch JSON
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { verifiedFetch } from '@helia/verified-fetch'
 * import { CID } from 'multiformats/cid'
 *
 * const cid = CID.parse('bafyFoo') // some image file
 * const response = await verifiedFetch(cid)
 * const json = await response.json()
 * ```
 *
 * @example Using IPFS protocol to fetch an image
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { verifiedFetch } from '@helia/verified-fetch'
 *
 * const response = await verifiedFetch('ipfs://bafyFoo') // CID for some image file
 * const blob = await response.blob()
 * const image = document.createElement('img')
 * image.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
 * document.body.appendChild(image)
 * ```
 *
 * @example Using IPNS protocol to stream a big file
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { verifiedFetch } from '@helia/verified-fetch'
 *
 * const response = await verifiedFetch('ipns://mydomain.com/path/to/very-long-file.log')
 * const bigFileStreamReader = await response.body.getReader()
 * ```
 *
 * ## Configuration
 *
 * ### Custom HTTP gateways and routers
 *
 * Out of the box `@helia/verified-fetch` uses a default set of [trustless gateways](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/) for fetching blocks and [HTTP delegated routers](https://specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1/) for performing routing tasks - looking up peers, resolving/publishing [IPNS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/) names, etc.
 *
 * It's possible to override these by passing `gateways` and `routers` keys to the `createVerifiedFetch` function:
 *
 * @example Configuring gateways and routers
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { createVerifiedFetch } from '@helia/verified-fetch'
 *
 * const fetch = await createVerifiedFetch({
 *  gateways: ['https://trustless-gateway.link'],
 *  routers: ['http://delegated-ipfs.dev']
 * })
 *
 * const resp = await fetch('ipfs://bafy...')
 *
 * const json = await resp.json()
 *```
 *
 * ### Usage with customized Helia
 *
 * For full control of how `@helia/verified-fetch` fetches content from the distributed web you can pass a preconfigured Helia node to `createVerifiedFetch`.
 *
 * The [helia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helia) module is configured with a libp2p node that is suited for decentralized applications, alternatively [@helia/http](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@helia/http) is available which uses HTTP gateways for all network operations.
 *
 * You can see variations of Helia and js-libp2p configuration options at https://helia.io/interfaces/helia.index.HeliaInit.html.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { trustlessGateway } from '@helia/block-brokers'
 * import { createHeliaHTTP } from '@helia/http'
 * import { delegatedHTTPRouting } from '@helia/routers'
 * import { createVerifiedFetch } from '@helia/verified-fetch'
 *
 * const fetch = await createVerifiedFetch(
 *   await createHeliaHTTP({
 *       blockBrokers: [
 *         trustlessGateway({
 *           gateways: ['https://mygateway.example.net', 'https://trustless-gateway.link']
 *         })
 *       ],
 *       routers: ['http://delegated-ipfs.dev'].map((routerUrl) => delegatedHTTPRouting(routerUrl))
 *     })
 * )
 *
 * const resp = await fetch('ipfs://bafy...')
 *
 * const json = await resp.json()
 * ```
 *
 * ### Custom content-type parsing
 *
 * By default, `@helia/verified-fetch` sets the `Content-Type` header as `application/octet-stream` - this is because the `.json()`, `.text()`, `.blob()`, and `.arrayBuffer()` methods will usually work as expected without a detailed content type.
 *
 * If you require an accurate content-type you can provide a `contentTypeParser` function as an option to `createVerifiedFetch` to handle parsing the content type.
 *
 * The function you provide will be called with the first chunk of bytes from the file and should return a string or a promise of a string.
 *
 * @example Customizing content-type parsing
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { createVerifiedFetch } from '@helia/verified-fetch'
 * import { fileTypeFromBuffer } from '@sgtpooki/file-type'
 *
 * const fetch = await createVerifiedFetch({
 *  gateways: ['https://trustless-gateway.link'],
 *  routers: ['http://delegated-ipfs.dev']
 * }, {
 *  contentTypeParser: async (bytes) => {
 *    // call to some magic-byte recognition library like magic-bytes, file-type, or your own custom byte recognition
 *    const result = await fileTypeFromBuffer(bytes)
 *    return result?.mime
 *  }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Comparison to fetch
 *
 * This module attempts to act as similarly to the `fetch()` API as possible.
 *
 * [The `fetch()` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) takes two parameters:
 *
 * 1. A [resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#resource)
 * 2. An [options object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#options)
 *
 * ### Resource argument
 *
 * This library supports the following methods of fetching web3 content from IPFS:
 *
 * 1. IPFS protocol: `ipfs://<cidv0>` & `ipfs://<cidv0>`
 * 2. IPNS protocol: `ipns://<peerId>` & `ipns://<publicKey>` & `ipns://<hostUri_Supporting_DnsLink_TxtRecords>`
 * 3. CID instances: An actual CID instance `CID.parse('bafy...')`
 *
 * As well as support for pathing & params for item 1 & 2 above according to [IPFS - Path Gateway Specification](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/path-gateway) & [IPFS - Trustless Gateway Specification](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/). Further refinement of those specifications specifically for web-based scenarios can be found in the [Web Pathing Specification IPIP](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/453).
 *
 * If you pass a CID instance, it assumes you want the content for that specific CID only, and does not support pathing or params for that CID.
 *
 * ### Options argument
 *
 * This library does not plan to support the exact Fetch API options object, as some of the arguments don't make sense. Instead, it will only support options necessary to meet [IPFS specs](https://specs.ipfs.tech/) related to specifying the resultant shape of desired content.
 *
 * Some of those header specifications are:
 *
 * 1. https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/path-gateway/#request-headers
 * 2. https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/#request-headers
 * 3. https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/subdomain-gateway/#request-headers
 *
 * Where possible, options and Helia internals will be automatically configured to the appropriate codec & content type based on the `verified-fetch` configuration and `options` argument passed.
 *
 * Known Fetch API options that will be supported:
 *
 * 1. `signal` - An AbortSignal that a user can use to abort the request.
 * 2. `redirect` - A string that specifies the redirect type. One of `follow`, `error`, or `manual`. Defaults to `follow`. Best effort to adhere to the [Fetch API redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#redirect) parameter.
 * 3. `headers` - An object of headers to be sent with the request. Best effort to adhere to the [Fetch API headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#headers) parameter.
 *     - `accept` - A string that specifies the accept header. Relevant values:
 *         - [`vnd.ipld.raw`](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipld.raw). (default)
 *         - [`vnd.ipld.car`](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipld.car)
 *         - [`vnd.ipfs.ipns-record`](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.ipfs.ipns-record)
 * 4. `method` - A string that specifies the HTTP method to use for the request. Defaults to `GET`. Best effort to adhere to the [Fetch API method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#method) parameter.
 * 5. `body` - An object that specifies the body of the request. Best effort to adhere to the [Fetch API body](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#body) parameter.
 * 6. `cache` - Will basically act as `force-cache` for the request. Best effort to adhere to the [Fetch API cache](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#cache) parameter.
 *
 * Non-Fetch API options that will be supported:
 *
 * 1. `onProgress` - Similar to Helia `onProgress` options, this will be a function that will be called with a progress event. Supported progress events are:
 *     - `helia:verified-fetch:error` - An error occurred during the request.
 *     - `helia:verified-fetch:request:start` - The request has been sent
 *     - `helia:verified-fetch:request:complete` - The request has been sent
 *     - `helia:verified-fetch:request:error` - An error occurred during the request.
 *     - `helia:verified-fetch:request:abort` - The request was aborted prior to completion.
 *     - `helia:verified-fetch:response:start` - The initial HTTP Response headers have been set, and response stream is started.
 *     - `helia:verified-fetch:response:complete` - The response stream has completed.
 *     - `helia:verified-fetch:response:error` - An error occurred while building the response.
 *
 * Some in-flight specs (IPIPs) that will affect the options object this library supports in the future can be seen at https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips, a subset are:
 *
 * 1. [IPIP-0412: Signaling Block Order in CARs on HTTP Gateways](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0412/)
 * 2. [IPIP-0402: Partial CAR Support on Trustless Gateways](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0402/)
 * 3. [IPIP-0386: Subdomain Gateway Interop with _redirects](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0386/)
 * 4. [IPIP-0328: JSON and CBOR Response Formats on HTTP Gateways](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0328/)
 * 5. [IPIP-0288: TAR Response Format on HTTP Gateways](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipips/ipip-0288/)
 *
 * ### Response types
 *
 * This library's purpose is to return reasonably representable content from IPFS. In other words, fetching content is intended for leaf-node content -- such as images/videos/audio & other assets, or other IPLD content (with link) -- that can be represented by https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response#instance_methods. The content type you receive back will depend upon the CID you request as well as the `Accept` header value you provide.
 *
 * All content we retrieve from the IPFS network is obtained via an AsyncIterable, and will be set as the [body of the HTTP Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response#body) via a [`ReadableStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Using_readable_streams#consuming_a_fetch_as_a_stream) or other efficient method that avoids loading the entire response into memory or getting the entire response from the network before returning a response to the user.
 *
 * If your content doesn't have a mime-type or an [IPFS spec](https://specs.ipfs.tech), this library will not support it, but you can use the [`helia`](https://github.com/ipfs/helia) library directly for those use cases. See [Unsupported response types](#unsupported-response-types) for more information.
 *
 * #### Handling response types
 *
 * For handling responses we want to follow conventions/abstractions from Fetch API where possible:
 *
 * - For JSON, assuming you abstract any differences between dag-json/dag-cbor/json/and json-file-on-unixfs, you would call `.json()` to get a JSON object.
 * - For images (or other web-relevant asset) you want to add to the DOM, use `.blob()` or `.arrayBuffer()` to get the raw bytes.
 * - For plain text in utf-8, you would call `.text()`
 * - For streaming response data, use something like `response.body.getReader()` to get a [`ReadableStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Using_readable_streams#consuming_a_fetch_as_a_stream).
 *
 * #### Unsupported response types
 *
 * * Returning IPLD nodes or DAGs as JS objects is not supported, as there is no currently well-defined structure for representing this data in an [HTTP Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response). Instead, users should request `aplication/vnd.ipld.car` or use the [`helia`](https://github.com/ipfs/helia) library directly for this use case.
 * * Others? Open an issue or PR!
 *
 * ### Response headers
 *
 * This library will set the [HTTP Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) headers to the appropriate values for the content type according to the appropriate [IPFS Specifications](https://specs.ipfs.tech/).
 *
 * Some known header specifications:
 *
 * * https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/path-gateway/#response-headers
 * * https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/#response-headers
 * * https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/subdomain-gateway/#response-headers
 *
 * ### Possible Scenarios that could cause confusion
 *
 * #### Attempting to fetch the CID for content that does not make sense
 *
 * If you request `bafybeiaysi4s6lnjev27ln5icwm6tueaw2vdykrtjkwiphwekaywqhcjze`, which points to the root of the en.wikipedia.org mirror, a response object does not make sense.
 *
 * ### Errors
 *
 * Known Errors that can be thrown:
 *
 * 1. `TypeError` - If the resource argument is not a string, CID, or CID string.
 * 2. `TypeError` - If the options argument is passed and not an object.
 * 3. `TypeError` - If the options argument is passed and is malformed.
 * 4. `AbortError` - If the content request is aborted due to user aborting provided AbortSignal.
