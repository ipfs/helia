This module implements the [Bitswap protocol](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/bitswap/) in TypeScript.

It supersedes the older [ipfs-bitswap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-bitswap) module with the aim of being smaller, faster, better integrated with libp2p/helia, having fewer dependencies and using standard JavaScript instead of Node.js APIs.

# Install

```console
$ npm i @helia/bitswap
```

## Browser `<script>` tag

Loading this module through a script tag will make it's exports available as `HeliaBitswap` in the global namespace.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@helia/bitswap/dist/index.min.js"></script>
