## Purpose and goals
A lean, modular, and modern implementation of IPFS for the prolific JS and browser environments.

See the [Manifesto](./MANIFESTO.md) and the [State of IPFS in JS blog post frpom 202210](https://blog.ipfs.tech/state-of-ipfs-in-js/) for more info.

## Project status

As of early 2023, this project is pre-alpha and is currently in development.  These initial building blocks are in development now; have a look at this repo's PR(s).  An initial v1 release is planned for [late Q1 2023](/ROADMAP.md#late-q1-march). 

## Roadmap
Please find and comment on [the Roadmap here](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/issues/5).

## Get involved
* We are sharing about the progress at periodic [Helia Demos](https://lu.ma/helia).  This is a good place to find out the latest and learn of ways to get involved.  We'd love to see you there!
* Pick up one of the [issues](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/issues).
* Come chat in Filecoin Slack #ip-js.  (Yes, we should bridge this to other chat enviornments.  Please comment [here](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/issues/33) if you'd like this.)

## Name

Helia (*HEE-lee-ah*) is the Latin spelling of Ἡλιη -- in Greek mythology, one of the [Heliades](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12656412): the daughters of the sun god Helios. When their brother Phaethon died trying to drive the sun chariot across the sky, their tears of mourning fell to earth as amber, which is yellow (sort of), and so is JavaScript. They were then turned into [poplar](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/poplar) trees and, well, JavaScript is quite popular.

In Oct–Dec 2022, [PL EngRes IP Stewards](https://pl-strflt.notion.site/IP-Stewards-9b65f88602474557b5d6f644194e941f) [sought community input](https://github.com/ipfs/pomegranate/issues/3) for the name of this project. After considering 20 suggestions and holding a couple of polls, the name **Helia** was chosen. Here's [why "ipfs" is not in the name](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/470).
