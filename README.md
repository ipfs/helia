# Helia — an implementation of IPFS in JavaScript

### Project status

This project is pre-alpha and is currently in development. An initial v1 release is planned for [late Q1 2023](/ROADMAP.md#late-q1-march). Helia is being built in the open; community contributors are welcome!

The core of IPFS is the [Files API](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/FILES.md), which will likewise be implemented in Helia. These initial building blocks are in development now; have a look at this repo's PR(s). For more info about Helia, please see the [Roadmap](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/issues/5) and the [Manifesto](MANIFESTO.md).

We are also sharing about the progress so far, and discussing how you can get involved, at [Helia Demo Day](https://lu.ma/helia) every couple weeks. We'd love to see you there!

## Name

Helia (_HEE-lee-ah_) is the Latin spelling of Ἡλιη -- in Greek mythology, one of the [Heliades](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12656412): the daughters of the sun god Helios. When their brother Phaethon died trying to drive the sun chariot across the sky, their tears of mourning fell to earth as amber, which is yellow (sort of), and so is JavaScript. They were then turned into [poplar](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/poplar) trees and, well, JavaScript is quite popular.

In Oct–Dec 2022, IP Stewards [sought](https://github.com/ipfs/pomegranate/issues/3) community input for the name of this project. After considering 20 suggestions and holding a couple of polls, the name **Helia** was chosen. Here's [why it's not named IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/470).

## Background

This project aims to build a lean, modular, modern implementation of IPFS, the Interplanetary File System.
